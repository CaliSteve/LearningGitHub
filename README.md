# LearningGitHub
This repository is to help me understand GIT source control

In this repository I will explain how these work:
* PUSH
  - command: git push <remote> <branch>  
  - This command specifies that you are pushing to the main branch(the Main Repository branch) on origin(the Main Repository)
* PULL
  - command: git pull <remote> <branch>
  -  This command pulls all the changes from Main Repository to your local repository
  - This is actually a combination of 2 other commands, git fetch followed by a git merge
* MERGE
* COMMIT
